# Products

Products represent specific products (e.g., wines, beers, spirits) that are the returned by the SDK. 


A ``Product`` can have one or more ``Variant``s. A variant can have one or more ``Tag``s which are used to associate a ``Product`` with a user's interaction (e.g., rating) or with a particular ``Collection``. With respect to a ``Customer``, a product return may also include ``PreferenceData`` which identifies the Customer's affinity for the product.
