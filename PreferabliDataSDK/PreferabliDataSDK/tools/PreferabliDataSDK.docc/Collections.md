# Collections

Collections are essentially groups of products. 


Collections are structured as follows: a ``Collection`` has one or more ``CollectionVersion``. Each version can have one or multiple ``CollectionGroup``. Each group can contain any amount of ``CollectionOrder``, which link directly to a ``Tag`` and thus a ``Product``.
