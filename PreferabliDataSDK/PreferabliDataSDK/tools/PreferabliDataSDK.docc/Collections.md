# Collections

Collections are essentially groups of products. 


Collections are structured as follows: a ``Collection`` has one or more ``CollectionVersion``s. Each version has one or more ``CollectionGroup``s. And each group contains one or more ``CollectionOrder``s, which link directly to a ``Tag`` and thus by reference a ``Product``.
