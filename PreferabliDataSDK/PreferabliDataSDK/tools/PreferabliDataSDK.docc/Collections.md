# Collections

Collections are essentially groups of products. 


Collections are structured as follows: a ``Collection`` has one or more ``CollectionVersion``. Each version can have one or more ``CollectionGroup``s. Each group can contain any number of ``CollectionOrder``s, which link directly to a ``Tag`` and thus a ``Product``.
