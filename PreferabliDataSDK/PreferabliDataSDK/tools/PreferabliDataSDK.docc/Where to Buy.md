# Where to Buy

These classes are all related to our Where to Buy functionality. 


``WhereToBuy`` is the container object which will include an array of either ``MerchantProductLink`` (if sorted by price) or ``Venue`` (if sorted by distance). See ``Preferabli/whereToBuy(product_id:fulfill_sort:append_nonconforming_results:lock_to_integration:onCompletion:onFailure:)`` for more information.
