# Products

Products are the main objects that you will encounter being returned by the SDK. 


A ``Product`` can have one or multiple ``Variant``. A variant can have one or many user ``Tag`` which are used to chronicle a user's interaction with a product. A product can also have ``PreferenceData`` which informs us of the user's affinity for the product.
