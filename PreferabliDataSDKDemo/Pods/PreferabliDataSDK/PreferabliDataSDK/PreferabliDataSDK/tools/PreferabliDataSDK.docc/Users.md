# Users

A user can be authenticated or not authenticated.  The authentication status determines which functionalities are available from the SDK.  An authenticated user can either by a ``Customer`` or a ``PreferabliUser``. 


Once authenticated, you can get a user's ``Profile`` by calling ``Preferabli/getProfile(force_refresh:onCompletion:onFailure:)``. For more on the user authentication process, see <doc:How-to-Use>.
